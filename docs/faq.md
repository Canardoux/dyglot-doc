## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Dyglot a language learning app?

No.
Dyglot is a learning engine.
Languages are only one possible use case.

### What is the difference between Dyglot and Anki?

Anki is card-centric and embeds presentation logic inside cards.
Dyglot separates:
- data (cards),
- pedagogy (views, filters, engines),
- and presentation (defined by the teacher).

### Do I need to know SQL, HTML, or programming to use Dyglot Teacher?

No.
Dyglot Teacher is explicitly designed for teachers who do not know —
and do not want to know — SQL, HTML, or programming concepts.

This is not a limitation.
It is a design requirement.

### What is a classroom?

A classroom is a closed learning space defined by a teacher.
It contains:
- cards (data),
- views (how cards are presented),
- filters (which cards are selected),
- and learning rules.

A classroom is not a database exposed to students.

### Can a classroom contain multiple types of cards?

Yes.
A classroom may define multiple card types,
as long as they are pedagogically coherent.
