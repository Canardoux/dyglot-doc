# Glossary

## Classroom (Course)
A *classroom* is a closed, coherent learning package that defines:
- which content is used,
- which views exist,
- which filters are offered,
- and how sessions are started.

A classroom can be local, downloadable, or remote.

## Card
The smallest learning unit. A card is a container of attributes and relations.
The engine does not impose meanings like "front/back" or "question/answer".

## View
A teacher-defined presentation of a card for the student.
A view may define separate layouts for:
- question phase
- answer phase
- browse mode

## Filter
A teacher-defined way to restrict the eligible cards for a session.
Students can select filters but must not create or edit them in the default UI.

## Session
A student's progression through cards within a given:
- classroom
- view
- filter
Sessions track state over time (practice or browse).
