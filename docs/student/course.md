# Courses (Classrooms)

In Dyglot, a **Course** (also called a *Classroom*) is a learning space created by a Teacher.

A Course defines:
- the cards you will study,
- the available views,
- the learning engines used,
- the filters you can choose from.

As a Student, you **do not modify** a Course.
You **select**, **open**, and **study** it.

## 1. What the Student Sees

When opening Dyglot Student, you interact with **Courses**, not databases or files.

For each Course, you can see:
- its name and description,
- the Teacher who created it,
- the available Views,
- your current learning progress (if any).

---

## 2. Managing Your Courses

Students can manage the list of Courses available on their device.

Possible actions include:
- opening a Course,
- downloading a Course for offline use,
- removing a Course from the device,
- adding a private Course (URL or local file).

Courses may be:
- bundled with the app,
- officially provided,
- published by trusted registrars,
- privately added by the student.

## 3. Choosing a Course to Study

At any time, the student can:
- select **which Course** to work on,
- switch to another Course without losing progress.

Each Course keeps its own sessions and history.

## 4. Sessions Are Course-Scoped

Learning sessions are always associated with:
- one Course,
- one View,
- one Filter.

Sessions from one Course **never interfere** with another Course.

This allows the student to:
- study multiple subjects independently,
- reset or continue progress course by course.

---

## 5. Resetting Progress

The student may reset:
- one session inside a Course,
- all sessions of a Course.

Resetting:
- does not delete the Course,
- restores all cards to their initial learning state.

---

## 6. Design Principle

> A Course belongs to the Teacher.  
> Progress belongs to the Student.

The student’s role is to learn —  
not to configure engines, databases, or presentation rules.
