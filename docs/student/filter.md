# Student — Filters: How to Choose Without Thinking

Filters help you focus your learning.

You do **not** need to understand how they work.
You only need to choose *what you want to practice today*.

Dyglot is designed so that choosing a Filter is:
- fast,
- safe,
- reversible.

---

## What a Filter Means for You

A **Filter** selects *which Cards* will be used during your practice.

That’s all.

It does not:
- erase your progress,
- change the content of the Course,
- affect other Filters.

Each Filter creates its **own learning path**.

---

## You Don’t Create Filters

In Dyglot, Filters are created by the Teacher.

This is intentional.

Why?
Because it means:
- every Filter has a clear meaning,
- Filters behave predictably,
- you never break anything by choosing one.

You can trust that each Filter does what its name says.

## How to Choose a Filter

When you open Dyglot, you usually see:
- a list of Filters,
- a short description (optional),
- a clear default choice.

Ask yourself just one question:

> “What do I want to practice *now*?”

Examples:
- I’m just starting → **Beginner**
- I want to review verbs → **Verbs**
- I want to focus on Hanja → **Hanja**
- I want everything → **All cards**

There is no wrong choice.

---

## Filters and Your Progress

Your progress is tracked **separately for each Filter**.

That means:
- switching Filters does not reset anything,
- you can return later exactly where you left off,
- different Filters can be at different stages.

Example:
- Beginner → almost finished
- Verbs → still in progress
- Hanja → not started yet

This is normal.

---

## Resetting a Filter (Optional)

Sometimes, you may want to start fresh.

Dyglot allows you to:
- reset your progress **for a specific Filter**,
- without affecting other Filters,
- without deleting the Course.

This option is usually available from a secondary menu.

Resetting means:
- all Cards in that Filter are treated as “not yet practiced”,
- your previous history is not mixed with the new one.

---

## Filters and Practice Modes

Filters work the same way whether you choose:
- **Practice**
- **Browse**

Practice:
- focuses on learning and repetition.

Browse:
- lets you explore the Cards freely,
- without scoring or scheduling.

The Filter only decides *which Cards are visible*.

---

## You Don’t Need to Optimize

You do not need to:
- combine Filters,
- fine-tune selections,
- think about efficiency.

The Teacher already did that work for you.

Your role is simple:
- choose a Filter,
- press **Practice**,
- focus on learning.

---

## If You’re Unsure, Use the Default

Every Course defines a **default Filter**.

If you don’t know what to choose:
- use the default,
- start practicing immediately.

You can always change later.

---

## Summary

Filters are here to **reduce decisions**, not add them.

You don’t need to understand them.
You don’t need to configure them.
You don’t need to optimize them.

Just choose what feels right *today* and start.

Learning should feel light.
