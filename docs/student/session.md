A session is your saved progress for one course, one view, and one filter.
When you tap Practice, Dyglot continues the existing session if it already exists.
If you want to restart from scratch, you can Reset the session — this puts all selected cards back into the Untested stack.

# Student — Sessions

A **Session** represents a student’s progression through a specific set of cards.

Sessions are a core concept in Dyglot, but they are intentionally kept **simple and understandable**.

---

## What Is a Session?

A Session is defined by the combination of:
- a Course,
- a View,
- a Filter.

Each combination has **at most one active session**.

If the student starts Practice with the same View and Filter again,
Dyglot resumes the existing session automatically.

---

## Why Sessions Exist

Sessions allow Dyglot to:
- remember which cards were already seen,
- track progress over time,
- resume learning exactly where the student stopped.

The student does **not** need to manage sessions manually in normal usage.

---

## Session Lifecycle

A session can be in one of these states:
- **New** — no card has been tested yet,
- **In progress** — some cards were already practiced,
- **Completed** — all cards have been tested at least once.

---

## Resetting a Session

Resetting a session means:
- all cards are put back into the initial “untested” state,
- progress is erased for that session only.

This is **intentional and important**:
- it allows the student to restart learning from scratch,
- without deleting data or reinstalling the course.

---

## Session Management Screen

Session management is accessible from the menu, not from the Home screen.

On the Sessions page, the student can:
- see sessions grouped by Course,
- identify View + Filter for each session,
- resume a session,
- reset a session.

---

## Reset Scopes

Depending on the context, Dyglot may offer:
- Reset this session
- Reset all sessions for this course
- (Expert mode) Reset all sessions

Clear wording and confirmation are mandatory for global resets.

---

## Student vs Expert Mode

In **normal mode**, the student can:
- reset individual sessions,
- reset sessions per course.

In **Expert mode**, additional options may appear:
- global reset,
- import/export of session data,
- diagnostics.

Expert mode is **explicitly enabled by the student**.

---

## What a Session Is Not

A session is **not**:
- a database,
- a classroom,
- a course definition,
- something shared between students.

Sessions are always **local to the student**.

---

## Mental Model for the Student

> “A session is my personal progress for one way of studying one set of cards.”

Nothing more is required.
