## About the Practice Screen

The Practice screen is **not hard-coded by Dyglot**.

Its structure, layout, and behavior are **defined by the Teacher who created the course**.

This is a fundamental design principle.

---

## Presentation Defined by the Teacher

Each Practice view:
- decides which fields are visible,
- how they are laid out,
- what is initially hidden or revealed,
- how the transition between question and answer happens.

For example:
- some views may reveal the answer by unmasking fields,
- others may switch to a different layout for the answer,
- others may present additional explanations or examples.

As a student, you do not configure this presentation.
You use it as intended by the Teacher.

---

## Practice Engine

Each view is also associated with a **practice engine**, chosen by the Teacher.

Examples of engines include:
- V1-compatible Dyglot engine,
- Anki-style engine,
- custom or experimental engines.

The engine defines:
- how answers are evaluated,
- which actions are available during practice,
- how progress is recorded.

---

## Action Buttons During Practice

When answering a question, the student is presented with **simple action buttons**.

The exact buttons depend on the selected engine, but typical examples include:
- *Wrong* / *Good*
- *Again* / *Hard* / *Easy*
- *Review later*
- *Mark as known*

These buttons:
- are intentionally limited,
- always have clear, explicit meaning,
- directly affect how the card progresses in the session.

The student does **not** need to understand the underlying algorithm.

---

## What to Expect as a Student

Because views are defined by Teachers:
- the appearance may vary from one course to another,
- some courses may feel very guided,
- others may feel more open or experimental.

This is normal.

Dyglot guarantees:
- consistency within a given course,
- predictable behavior of buttons,
- safety of your personal progress data.

---

## When Documentation Is Minimal

Some courses may come with little or no documentation.

In that case:
- rely on the visible buttons,
- trust the labels and immediate feedback,
- use *Browse* mode to explore cards freely if needed.

Dyglot is designed so that **a course remains usable even without extensive explanations**.

# Student — Practice Screen  
*(What Depends on the Teacher)*

This page explains what the **Practice screen** is from the Student’s point of view,
and why it may look different from one course to another.

The key idea is simple:

> **The student practices.  
> The teacher defines how practice looks.**

---

## What Is the Practice Screen?

The **Practice screen** is where learning actually happens.

It is the screen where:
- a question is presented,
- the student thinks,
- an answer is revealed or validated,
- progress is recorded.

Every practice session happens inside a **View** defined by the Teacher.

---

## Why Practice Screens Can Look Different

In Dyglot, there is no single, universal practice UI.

This is intentional.

Different teachers design different pedagogies:
- vocabulary drills,
- recognition exercises,
- recall exercises,
- exploration modes.

As a result, the **presentation**, **actions**, and even **feedback style**
of the Practice screen depend on the Teacher’s choices.

---

## What the Teacher Defines

For each View used in Practice mode, the Teacher defines:

### 1. The Presentation Model

- **Reveal-based** (fields are progressively shown)
- **Two-sided** (Question side / Answer side)

The student does not choose this — the View does.

---

### 2. What Is Shown

Examples of fields that may appear:
- words or expressions
- translations
- audio buttons
- grammar information
- examples
- writing systems (Hanja, Kana, etc.)

Some fields may be:
- visible immediately,
- hidden until reveal,
- shown only on the answer.

---

### 3. The Learning Engine Type

Each View is associated with a **learning engine**, chosen by the Teacher.

Typical engine types include:
- **V1-like** (simple Good / Wrong flow)
- **Anki-like** (spaced repetition decisions)
- **Custom engines** (future)

The engine determines:
- what buttons appear,
- what choices the student can make,
- how progress is updated.

---

## What the Student Controls

Even though the Teacher defines the structure, the Student remains in control of learning.

The Student can:
- choose a View,
- choose a predefined Filter,
- start Practice or Browse mode,
- answer honestly,
- reset sessions if needed.

The Student does **not** design the practice rules.

---

## Typical Student Actions During Practice

Depending on the engine, the student may see buttons such as:
- **Good**
- **Wrong**
- **Again**
- **Later**
- **Easy**
- **Hard**

These buttons:
- are intentionally simple,
- are limited in number,
- are defined by the Teacher’s chosen engine.

---

## Why This Simplicity Matters

The Practice screen is designed to avoid:
- configuration overload,
- decision fatigue,
- accidental pedagogy changes.

Students focus on learning — not on tuning the system.

---

## If the Teacher Did Not Document the View

Sometimes, a Teacher may not provide detailed documentation.

In that case:
- the Practice screen itself is the documentation,
- the student learns by doing,
- the UI remains consistent within the same course.

Dyglot favors **self-explanatory interaction** over manuals.

---

## Practice vs Browse

Not all Views are for Practice.

Some Views may be:
- **Practice views** (with progress tracking)
- **Browse views** (free exploration, no scoring)

This distinction is also defined by the Teacher.

---

## Summary

- The Practice screen is where learning happens
- Its structure depends on the Teacher
- Its behavior depends on the learning engine
- The Student focuses on answering, not configuring
- Simplicity is a design requirement
