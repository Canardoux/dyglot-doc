# Student — Practice Screen  
*(What Depends on the Teacher)*

## Why this page exists

The Practice Screen is the core of the Dyglot Student experience.

It is where:
- questions are shown,
- answers are revealed,
- progress is recorded.

At the same time, the Practice Screen can look very different from one Course to another.

This is not accidental.

In Dyglot v2, **the Practice Screen is largely defined by the Teacher**.

This page explains what the Student can expect — and why some things may vary.

---

## What the Student sees, at a glance

When entering Practice mode, the Student typically sees:

- One card at a time
- A clear question
- A way to reveal or access the answer
- A small set of simple action buttons

Everything else — layout, fields, typography — depends on the Course.

---

## The role of the Teacher

The Teacher defines:

- Which **Views** are available
- Which **fields** appear in each View
- How the **Question View** looks
- How the **Answer View** looks
- Which **engine** drives the interaction

The Student does not configure these elements.

> If the Practice Screen looks a certain way,  
> it is because the Teacher designed it that way.

---

## Question and Answer flow

In most Courses, Practice mode follows this pattern:

1. A **Question View** is displayed  
2. The Student thinks or answers mentally  
3. The **Answer View** is displayed  
4. The Student chooses an action (buttons)

Question and Answer are two distinct Views.
They may show different fields and layouts.

---

## Action buttons (engine-dependent)

The buttons available to the Student depend on the **engine** selected by the Teacher.

### Example — V1-like engine
Typical buttons:
- **Good**
- **Wrong**
- **Later**

### Example — Anki-like engine
Typical buttons:
- **Again**
- **Hard**
- **Good**
- **Easy**

### Example — Custom engine
Buttons may differ depending on the Course.

The Student does not choose the engine.
They only interact with the buttons provided.

---

## What is always simple

Regardless of the Course or engine:

- The number of buttons is small
- The labels are explicit
- No configuration is required during practice
- No technical knowledge is expected

Practice mode is designed to be:
- focused,
- repetitive,
- low-friction.

---

## What the Student can control

The Student can:
- Choose a **View** (if multiple are available)
- Choose a **Filter** (predefined by the Teacher)
- Start or resume a Practice session
- Reset a session

The Student cannot:
- Modify Views
- Change field visibility
- Alter scoring rules
- Redefine pedagogy

---

## Why this matters

Dyglot v1 allowed Students to tweak many presentation settings.
This caused confusion and inconsistency.

Dyglot v2 makes a clear choice:

> **Students learn. Teachers design.**

This separation keeps Practice mode:
- predictable,
- understandable,
- and reliable.

---

## When documentation is minimal

Some Teachers may provide extensive documentation.
Others may provide very little.

Dyglot v2 is designed so that:
- Practice remains usable even without detailed explanations
- The UI itself communicates what matters
- Students are not required to understand the internal model

If a Course works well, the Student should not need to read anything.

---

## Summary

- The Practice Screen is **Course-defined**
- Views and engines are chosen by the Teacher
- The Student experience remains simple
- Differences between Courses are intentional
- Pedagogy is upstream, not user-configurable

If something looks different from another Course,  
it is not a bug — it is a teaching choice.

## About the Practice Screen

The Practice screen is **not hard-coded by Dyglot**.

Its structure, layout, and behavior are **defined by the Teacher who created the course**.

This is a fundamental design principle.

---

## Presentation Defined by the Teacher

Each Practice view:
- decides which fields are visible,
- how they are laid out,
- what is initially hidden or revealed,
- how the transition between question and answer happens.

For example:
- some views may reveal the answer by unmasking fields,
- others may switch to a different layout for the answer,
- others may present additional explanations or examples.

As a student, you do not configure this presentation.
You use it as intended by the Teacher.

---

## Practice Engine

Each view is also associated with a **practice engine**, chosen by the Teacher.

Examples of engines include:
- V1-compatible Dyglot engine,
- Anki-style engine,
- custom or experimental engines.

The engine defines:
- how answers are evaluated,
- which actions are available during practice,
- how progress is recorded.

---

## Action Buttons During Practice

When answering a question, the student is presented with **simple action buttons**.

The exact buttons depend on the selected engine, but typical examples include:
- *Wrong* / *Good*
- *Again* / *Hard* / *Easy*
- *Review later*
- *Mark as known*

These buttons:
- are intentionally limited,
- always have clear, explicit meaning,
- directly affect how the card progresses in the session.

The student does **not** need to understand the underlying algorithm.

---

## What to Expect as a Student

Because views are defined by Teachers:
- the appearance may vary from one course to another,
- some courses may feel very guided,
- others may feel more open or experimental.

This is normal.

Dyglot guarantees:
- consistency within a given course,
- predictable behavior of buttons,
- safety of your personal progress data.

---

## When Documentation Is Minimal

Some courses may come with little or no documentation.

In that case:
- rely on the visible buttons,
- trust the labels and immediate feedback,
- use *Browse* mode to explore cards freely if needed.

Dyglot is designed so that **a course remains usable even without extensive explanations**.

# Student — Practice Screen  
*(What Depends on the Teacher)*

This page explains what the **Practice screen** is from the Student’s point of view,
and why it may look different from one course to another.

The key idea is simple:

> **The student practices.  
> The teacher defines how practice looks.**

---

## What Is the Practice Screen?

The **Practice screen** is where learning actually happens.

It is the screen where:
- a question is presented,
- the student thinks,
- an answer is revealed or validated,
- progress is recorded.

Every practice session happens inside a **View** defined by the Teacher.

---

## Why Practice Screens Can Look Different

In Dyglot, there is no single, universal practice UI.

This is intentional.

Different teachers design different pedagogies:
- vocabulary drills,
- recognition exercises,
- recall exercises,
- exploration modes.

As a result, the **presentation**, **actions**, and even **feedback style**
of the Practice screen depend on the Teacher’s choices.

---

## What the Teacher Defines

For each View used in Practice mode, the Teacher defines:

### 1. The Presentation Model

- **Reveal-based** (fields are progressively shown)
- **Two-sided** (Question side / Answer side)

The student does not choose this — the View does.

---

### 2. What Is Shown

Examples of fields that may appear:
- words or expressions
- translations
- audio buttons
- grammar information
- examples
- writing systems (Hanja, Kana, etc.)

Some fields may be:
- visible immediately,
- hidden until reveal,
- shown only on the answer.

---

### 3. The Learning Engine Type

Each View is associated with a **learning engine**, chosen by the Teacher.

Typical engine types include:
- **V1-like** (simple Good / Wrong flow)
- **Anki-like** (spaced repetition decisions)
- **Custom engines** (future)

The engine determines:
- what buttons appear,
- what choices the student can make,
- how progress is updated.

---

## What the Student Controls

Even though the Teacher defines the structure, the Student remains in control of learning.

The Student can:
- choose a View,
- choose a predefined Filter,
- start Practice or Browse mode,
- answer honestly,
- reset sessions if needed.

The Student does **not** design the practice rules.

---

## Typical Student Actions During Practice

Depending on the engine, the student may see buttons such as:
- **Good**
- **Wrong**
- **Again**
- **Later**
- **Easy**
- **Hard**

These buttons:
- are intentionally simple,
- are limited in number,
- are defined by the Teacher’s chosen engine.

---

## Why This Simplicity Matters

The Practice screen is designed to avoid:
- configuration overload,
- decision fatigue,
- accidental pedagogy changes.

Students focus on learning — not on tuning the system.

---

## If the Teacher Did Not Document the View

Sometimes, a Teacher may not provide detailed documentation.

In that case:
- the Practice screen itself is the documentation,
- the student learns by doing,
- the UI remains consistent within the same course.

Dyglot favors **self-explanatory interaction** over manuals.

---

## Practice vs Browse

Not all Views are for Practice.

Some Views may be:
- **Practice views** (with progress tracking)
- **Browse views** (free exploration, no scoring)

This distinction is also defined by the Teacher.

---

## Summary

- The Practice screen is where learning happens
- Its structure depends on the Teacher
- Its behavior depends on the learning engine
- The Student focuses on answering, not configuring
- Simplicity is a design requirement
