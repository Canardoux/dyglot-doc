## Student FAQ

### Do I need to configure anything before starting?

No.
A teacher prepares the classroom.
You only choose:
- a view,
- a filter,
- and press “Practice” or “Browse”.

### Can I reset my progress?

Yes.
You can reset sessions and start again at any time.

### Why can’t I edit cards or filters?

Because classrooms are defined by teachers.
This ensures consistency and pedagogical coherence.
