# Student — Home Screen

The Home screen is the **core of the Dyglot Student experience**.

It is designed so that a student can:
- open the app,
- make **two or three simple choices**,
- start learning immediately.

Everything else lives elsewhere.

---

## Design Principle

> **If a student feels lost on the Home screen, the design has failed.**

The Home screen is **not**:
- a configuration panel,
- a technical dashboard,
- a place to manage data.

It is only about **learning now**.

---

## Home Screen Structure

The Home screen contains exactly four elements:

### 1. Course (Classroom)

The currently active course.

- By default, Dyglot always has a **current course**.
- On first launch, this is a built-in *starter course*.
- A discreet “Change…” action allows selecting another course.

The student does **not** manage storage or downloads here.

---

### 2. View

A **View** defines *how a card is presented*.

Examples:
- Korean → English
- English → Korean
- Hanja view
- Any custom view defined by the Teacher

The student selects **one view at a time**, using radio buttons.

Views are **defined by the Teacher**, not by the student.

---

### 3. Filter

A **Filter** defines *which cards are included* in the session.

Examples:
- Beginner cards
- High-frequency words
- Verbs only
- Lesson 1

Filters are **predefined by the Teacher**.

The student can:
- choose one filter,
- but **cannot create or edit filters** from the Home screen.

---

### 4. Action Buttons

Two large, explicit buttons:

- **Practice**
- **Browse**

**Practice**
- starts (or resumes) a learning session,
- cards are presented according to the selected View and Filter.

**Browse**
- allows free navigation through the same card selection,
- without question/answer logic.

---

## What Is Intentionally Not Here

The Home screen never shows:
- session history,
- progress statistics,
- database concepts,
- expert settings,
- technical identifiers.

All of these are available elsewhere.

---

## First Launch Experience

On first launch:
- a default course is already selected,
- a default view and filter are preselected,
- the student can press **Practice** immediately.

A subtle hint may invite the student to discover more courses later.

---

## Mental Model for the Student

> “I choose *how* I want to see cards (View),  
> I choose *which* cards I want to work on (Filter),  
> then I Practice or Browse.”

That is all the student needs to know.
