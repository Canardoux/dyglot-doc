# Student — Courses, Views, and Filters  
## What You Actually Choose (and What You Don’t)

As a Student, Dyglot is intentionally simple.

You are **not** expected to understand:
- databases,
- card structures,
- learning engines,
- or how the content was built.

Those choices were made **by the Teacher**.

This page explains **what you choose**, and just as importantly, **what you don’t**.

---

## The Only Three Things You Choose

When you start practicing in Dyglot, you only choose:

1. **A Course**
2. **A View**
3. **A Filter**

Then you press **Practice** (or **Browse**).

That’s it.

---

## Course — *“What am I learning?”*

A **Course** represents a learning path designed by a Teacher.

Examples:
- *Korean → English (Beginner)*
- *Hanja Recognition*
- *Solfège — Reading Notes*
- *Advanced Vocabulary Review*

### What this means for you

- A Course already knows:
  - what content it uses,
  - how it should be learned,
  - which learning logic applies.

You don’t configure the Course.
You **select** it.

---

## View — *“How do I see the cards?”*

A **View** defines how information is presented on screen.

Examples:
- Korean → English
- English → Korean
- Hanja view
- Browse mode
- Listening-only mode

### Important

- Views are **defined by the Teacher**.
- You cannot break anything by choosing one.
- Different Views may show:
  - different fields,
  - different layouts,
  - different interactions.

From your perspective, a View is simply:
> “The way I want to work right now.”

---

## Filter — *“Which cards do I work on?”*

A **Filter** selects a subset of cards inside the Course.

Examples:
- Beginner cards only
- Cards you answered wrong recently
- New cards
- A specific lesson or chapter

### Very important rule

> **All Filters are predefined by the Teacher.**

You do **not**:
- create filters,
- edit filters,
- manage complex criteria.

This is intentional.

It keeps the entry screen simple and safe.

---

## Practice vs Browse

Once you have chosen:
- a Course,
- a View,
- a Filter,

you choose **how to use them**.

### Practice

- You enter a learning session.
- Cards are presented one by one.
- You answer using simple buttons (e.g. *Wrong*, *Good*, *Again*).
- The exact buttons depend on the learning engine chosen by the Teacher.

### Browse

- You freely explore the cards.
- No scoring.
- No pressure.
- No progression impact.

## Sessions — What Dyglot Remembers for You

Each combination of:
- Course
- View
- Filter

creates a **Session**.

A Session remembers:
- which cards you have seen,
- how you answered them,
- where you left off.

You don’t need to manage this.
Dyglot does it automatically.

---

## Resetting a Session (Yes, You Can)

Sometimes you want to start over.

Dyglot allows you to:
- reset a specific session,
- or reset all your progress for a Course.

Resetting means:
- all cards return to their initial state,
- nothing is deleted,
- you can relearn from scratch.

This is normal and expected.

---

## What You Never Have to Care About

As a Student, you never need to think about:
- how cards are stored,
- how many CardSets exist,
- how Courses were built,
- how Views were implemented,
- or which learning engine is used internally.

If you are forced to think about these things, something went wrong.

---

## One Sentence Summary

> **Choose a Course, choose a View, choose a Filter — then practice.**

Everything else exists so that you don’t have to think about it.
