# Licensing Philosophy (for Teachers)

Dyglot Teacher is designed for teachers who create pedagogical content:
CardSets, Courses, Views, Filters, and Classrooms.

These elements are considered **data and pedagogical structures**, not
program code.

## What this means

- Dyglot Teacher itself is licensed under the GNU GPL.
- The classrooms you create with Dyglot **remain your own work**.
- You are free to choose how to license and distribute your classrooms:
  - proprietary
  - Creative Commons
  - open-source
  - private or commercial

Using Dyglot does **not** impose the GPL on your pedagogical content.

## Why this matters

Dyglot intentionally separates:
- the **learning engine** (software),
- from the **knowledge and pedagogy** (content).

This separation protects teachers:
- from legal ambiguity,
- from accidental license obligations,
- and from having to understand software licensing in depth.

You focus on teaching.
Dyglot handles the engine.

## Documentation License

The dyglot documentation is published under the Creative Common CC-BY-NC-SA.
If the teacher use the Diglot Template Documention for his/her own classoom, he/she must publish hi/her own documentation under the same license CC-BY-NC-SA.

## Documentation and Licensing

Dyglot documentation and the official Classroom Template Documentation
are published under the **Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA** license.

This means:
- you are free to reuse and adapt these documents,
- attribution is required,
- commercial use is not permitted,
- and derivative documentation must remain under the same license.

### Using the Classroom Documentation Template

If you use the Dyglot Classroom Documentation Template as a basis for your own
classroom documentation, your resulting documentation **must be published
under CC-BY-NC-SA**.

This is an intentional choice:
- documentation is considered pedagogical material,
- and its evolution benefits from shared improvements.

### Dyglot Engine, Applications, and Data

Dyglot Engine and Dyglot Student are licensed under the GNU GPL.

If you distribute an application that embeds Dyglot (for example on the
App Store or Google Play), the application code and engine are subject to
the GPL.

However, this **does not automatically apply** to:
- CardSets
- Courses
- Classrooms
- pedagogical databases
- audio, text, or media assets

These elements are treated as **data**, not executable code.

Their license remains entirely under the control of the teacher or author.

### Important clarification

Only program code derived from Dyglot is subject to the GPL.

Pedagogical content remains independent, provided it is not implemented
as executable code or engine extensions.

## Commercial Use and Classrooms

Dyglot is an open and free learning engine, but it is **not intended to be a
free backend for proprietary commercial applications**.

### Selling a classroom

Teachers may:
- distribute classrooms freely,
- share them publicly or privately,
- request financial support, subscriptions, or access fees **outside of an app store**.

This includes:
- private access to a classroom,
- paid educational content,
- courses or teaching services using Dyglot as a client.

### Commercial applications

Embedding Dyglot Engine and classroom data inside a **paid mobile application**
(iOS, Android, etc.) is **not permitted without explicit authorization** from
the Dyglot project.

This restriction exists to:
- protect the integrity of the Dyglot ecosystem,
- prevent free-riding on a community-driven engine,
- and ensure fair contribution to the project.

### The Dyglot Korean exception

Applications published by the Dyglot authors (such as Dyglot Korean)
are considered official distributions and are not subject to this restriction.

## Commercial Use and Classrooms

Dyglot is a free and open learning engine.
However, it is **not intended to be used as a free backend for proprietary
commercial applications**.

### Selling a classroom

Teachers may:
- distribute classrooms freely,
- share them publicly or privately,
- request financial support, subscriptions, or access fees **outside of app stores**.

This includes:
- private or paid access to a classroom,
- educational content,
- teaching services using Dyglot as a client.

Classroom data itself is not restricted to free distribution, but its use
must respect the Dyglot ecosystem and licenses.

### Commercial applications

Embedding Dyglot Engine together with classroom data inside a **paid mobile
application** (iOS, Android, etc.) is **not permitted without explicit authorization**.

This restriction exists to:
- protect the integrity of the Dyglot project,
- prevent free-riding on a community-driven engine,
- ensure that commercial benefits do not bypass community contribution.

Dyglot is designed as a shared educational tool, not as a commercial SDK.
