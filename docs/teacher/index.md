# Teacher Overview

!!! note
Dyglot Teacher is designed for people who do not know — and do not want to know —
HTML, SQL, or programming concepts.

This is not a limitation. It is a design requirement.

Teachers:
- define classrooms (courses),
- define views (what students see),
- define filters (what students can choose),
- publish classrooms for students.

Teachers do not manage schemas or databases.
Teachers work with concepts: cards, attributes, views, filters.
