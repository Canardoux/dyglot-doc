# Dyglot — Documentation (Draft)

This repository contains a **working draft of the Dyglot documentation**.

It is primarily:
- a **design notebook**,
- a **conceptual specification**,
- and a shared space for discussion between the Dyglot author(s).

This documentation is **intentionally ahead of the code**.

---

## Status

⚠️ **Early design phase**

- Concepts are still evolving
- Terminology may change
- Some sections may contradict each other temporarily

This is expected and accepted.

Clarity comes before stability.

---

## Scope

This documentation covers three main perspectives:

- **Student** — how Dyglot is experienced by learners
- **Teacher** — how courses, views, and filters are designed
- **Engine** — how the system is structured conceptually

Not all sections are equally mature.

---

## Tooling (not fixed yet)

The documentation is currently rendered using a static site generator,
but **the toolchain is not yet a final decision**.

Possible options include:
- MkDocs
- Jekyll
- Just-the-docs
- or another static documentation system

The **content matters more than the generator** at this stage.

---

## Contributions

This repository is not yet open to general contributions.

However:
- feedback,
- conceptual discussions,
- and careful reviews

are welcome once the core ideas stabilize.

---

## Philosophy

Dyglot is designed around a strong principle:

> Teachers do not need to know HTML, SQL, or programming.  
> This is not a limitation. It is a design requirement.

If a document violates this principle, it is likely wrong.
